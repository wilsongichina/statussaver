  - question: How does status saver for WhatsApp work?
    answer: By taking the steps below, you can save your contacts' WhatsApp statuses
      on your smartphone. To copy something to another location, select Copy To from
      the pull-down menu by tapping on the downward pointing arrow next to the Status
      (video or photo) that you wish to save. The application will now display areas
      in which you can save the chosen WhatsApp Status, such as your device's internal
      storage. To store the Status, tap the location where you wish to save the downloaded
      item.
  - question: Is WhatsApp status automatically saved?
    answer: The status files are locally saved by WhatsApp on the device. However,
      these are removed within a day. To save them in a safe place, you can transfer
      them out of the temporary file. The status images and videos you have viewed
      during the last 24 hours on WhatsApp are automatically downloaded to your device's
      file explorer. Therefore, you are not required to use a third-party tool like
      WhatsApp Status Saver. However, WhatsApp status Saver is recommended to save
      movies and photographs because the folder in which the media files are stored
      is concealed by default.
  - question: Can I save someone’s WhatsApp status?
    answer: Your mobile phone has to have a file management program to preserve the
      status. In general, this application is on many devices, but you can download
      it if you can't seem to find it. Additionally, you may simply use an app to
      capture and store the status images and videos of your contacts. Install the
      WhatsApp Status Saver app from the Play Store to accomplish this. Open the app,
      then choose the pictures and videos you wish to save onto your phone. The images
      and videos will now be continuously saved on your phone when you hit the Save
      icon.
  - question: Where does WhatsApp status get saved?
    answer: You instantly save media files to your WhatsApp/Media/folder. The WhatsApp
      folder is housed in your device's internal storage if you have it. The folder
      will be located on your SD Card or External SD Card if your device lacks internal
      memory. As an option, when you have hidden files accessible, you should be able
      to access the Media folder and see a folder called Statuses. All of the WhatsApp
      Status pictures and videos you've seen are saved in this folder and may be retrieved
      from there.
  - question: How can I check WhatsApp status without seeing it?
    answer: The individuals who have watched Status are visible when you tap the eye
      icon. But here's how to prevent your name from showing up in the list of status
      views. Deactivate read receipts. We are all aware of how read receipts for conversations
      function, but you can also use them to verify someone's position officially
      without letting them know. Toggle "Read receipts" to enable this so you can
      check your Whatsapp messages privately by going to Settings > Account > Privacy.
